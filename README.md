# Poker-Hand-Strength-Visualizer

## TO DO:

Backend:
- Implement algorithm1 and algorithm2. (Can rename for clarity once we've agreed upon algorithms to use based on assignment requirements)
 -- Two comparable combinatorial approaches? e.g. 1. Iterative Approach Using Hash Tables vs 2. Recursive Approach Using Graphs


Frontend:
- ~~Debug missing AD card in the selection GUI~~ Evidently, my Google Chrome adblock extension was somehow interfering with the AD card specifically haha
- ~~Style the card selection GUI into a grid format (4 columns x 13 rows)~~
- ~~Gray out selected cards (e.g., change to a white rectangle)~~
- ~~Populate the selected card images into the "Your Hand" and "Table Cards" input boxes as opposed to 2 alphanumeric characters in boxes~~
- ~~Allow removal of a card by clicking on populated card image instead of the current "X" system~~
- ~~Ensure input from the frontend is properly processed as parameters for our algorithm functions~~
- ~~Display the results once the "CALCULATE!" button is clicked~~
- Add further CSS styling
