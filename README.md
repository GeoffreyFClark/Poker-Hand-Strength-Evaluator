# Poker-Hand-Strength-Visualizer

![image](nov23frontend.png)

## TO DO:

Backend:
- Implement algorithm1 and algorithm2. (Rename for clarity once we've agreed upon algorithms to use)
- Ensure input from the frontend is properly processed as parameters for our algorithm functions

Frontend:
- ~~Debug missing AD card in the selection GUI~~ Evidently, my Google Chrome adblock extension was somehow interfering with the AD card specifically haha
- ~~Style the card selection GUI into a grid format (4 columns x 13 rows)~~
- ~~Gray out selected cards (e.g., change to a white rectangle)~~
- ~~Populate the selected card images into the "Your Hand" and "Table Cards" input boxes as opposed to 2 alphanumeric characters in boxes~~
- ~~Allow removal of a card by clicking on populated card image instead of the current "X" system~~
- Add further CSS styling
- Display the results once the "CALCULATE!" button is clicked (pending completion of algorithm1 and algorithm2)
